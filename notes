Hook allows us to do things that we generally only do in the class components.

useState: 
return two things actual value and a func to change the value.
we have uuid@3.3.2 package to generate unique IDs.

useEffect:
it takes two things one is callback function and second one is the array of dependencies
dependecies could be anything
nothing is passed then it will run on every state change.
if it is [] it will only run on initial render
if it is [age] it will only run if the value of age state changes
